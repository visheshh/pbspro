 *		3. Also if a Secondary has registered,  the "secondary_active" file is
 *	   	status-ed to see if it exists;  this is created by the Secondary
 *	   	when it goes active.  If this file is present, the Primary will
 *	   	restart itself in an attempt to take backover.

 *		really isn't up, and change set to "take over" which causes a retry
